# Inspiration
What is the first thing which strikes your mind when you hear about carbon emissions ? Many people think of common contributors such as the burning of fossil fuels, the use of planes and other transports, or the production of items such as clothes and toys. Very few people, however, think of the environmental impact of using the internet.

WebCarbon is a Chrome Extension which tracks the amount of carbon generated from using the internet and browsing websites. It is designed to educate people on the contributions of the internet to climate change, and urge them to see how their daily lives are causing large impact on the planet.
